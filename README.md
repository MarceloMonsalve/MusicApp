<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was made to create a new way for people to share music. My friend Ricardo realize that there was no social media soley dedicated to sharing songs you like with your friends so thats what this app does. Friends can follow each other and post songs they like and comment on them. The app is meant to be a cool way for people to discover new music and keep in touch with their friends. Some people have really good music taste so this app will be a good place to show that.




<!-- Authorization -->
## Authorization and User Profile

At this stage users can create accounts or login using Firebase's Auth library. The login is through Apple to make it easy for the user since this app will be iOS exclusive. The app will ask the user to choose a username then allow them to continue to the feed. The user can further edit their profile from the settings accesible from their profile.
